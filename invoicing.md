# How an invoice is created
## B2B 
The invoice creation is dependent from the purchase agreement that is negotiated with each customer. The user should be able to send the invoice togther with the package that contains the products or seperatly via email or letter. Depending on purchase agreements (part of order confirmation), that are negotiated with each customer, the goods are sent to the customer only if the customer payed the bill. 

### Commercial Agents
Commercial agents sell goods from the user. But the goods are sent to the customer. They are usually paid proportional by their turnover at the end of the month. The user currently doesn't need further policies. Just for interest, policy designs can be found (here)[https://www.mittelstandswiki.de/wissen/Vertriebsprovision].

## B2C
In the B2C model, invoices are usually created by an external e-commerce system.
