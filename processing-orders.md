# How a user is processing orders
Orders are sent from retailers (B2B) or consumer (C2B) by email, fax, telephone or an external e-commerce system. The user should be therefore able to create an order by hand (use case "import order"). Some positions of the orders can't be processed due to e.g. unavailability. Therefore the user checks the order positions and confirmes the positions, that are available (use case confirm order). The document "order agreement" is a legal obligation to deliver and is sent to the customer. Anyhow, the main purpose of order-processor is to ease the delivery work (e.g. package packing) of the user by providing the information which products in which quantities have to be delivered to which customer (use case deliver). In the moment the delivery suceeded, the user has fulfilled its obligation. The user creates invoices usually by external accounting systems, that are also defining the terms of payment.

## Use case "import order"
Order positions refer to products with an SKU-number and to unique products that are not listed in any catalog. The user should be able to handle also products, that are not listed anywhere. For products that are in a catalog (e.g. magento), the SKU number with its name should be suggested. The products are saved in an external product catalog.

## Use case "deliver"
The delivery process is usually packing packets and sending the via a parcel service like UPS, DHL etc. Because each packet is sent individually, a "delivery notes" that reflects the content (product, category, quatity) of the packet is put to each packet. The delivery quantity of a product can exceed the available quantity in the warehouse. In this case the user delivers the quantity that is available and procures an additional stock by an external system. The stock of available products are also handled externally. As consequence a delivery note can contain positions from multiple order agreements. The invoice is sent either in one of the package of a delivery, or seperately. The payment conditions and policies are also handled by external systems.
